# React Composition 4

Create a Form component that accepts a onSubmit callback and a list of fields objects with properties name, type, and label.

The component should render an input field for each object in the fields prop, with the label property as the label for the input field. 

When the form is submitted, the onSubmit callback should be called with an object containing the values of each input field.
